## CS 6601: Artificial Intelligence

Great textbook: [AI: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)
- Topics:
  - Adversarial search / game playing (i.e., minimax, alpha-beta, iterative deepening, killer move (detection), etc)
  - Search (i.e., uniform cost search (UCS), A-star search (A), bi-directional UCS/A, tri-directional UCS/A*)
  - Bayesian networks (i.e., probabilistic modelling, Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings sampling)
  - Decision Trees (i.e., splitting, random forests, boosting, validation, etc.)
  - Expectation maximisation (i.e., k-means, gaussian mixture models)
  - Hidden Markov Models (i.e., Viterbi trellis, adjusting for noise)

- Projects: 
  - design minimax/alpha-beta game agents
  - implement/test classical search algorithms such as A*
  - implement/test Bayesian inference algorithms
  - implement/test Decision trees/Random forests
  - implement/test KMeans/Gaussian Mixture Models for image compression
  - implement/test Hidden Markov Models for identifying Morse Code sequences
